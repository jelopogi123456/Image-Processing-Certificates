# Image-Processing-Full-Track-

Much of the data in the world are formatted as images. Image processing has become a crucial skill to have in your data science toolbox. This track covers the fundamentals, from image pre-processing to deep learning. You'll begin with image enhancement and restoration and move on to biomedical images to analyze more complex image types, like MRI scans and X-rays. The track concludes with a course on convolutional neural nets, where you'll learn to build powerful deep learning image classifiers.
